    <title>HTML Attributes</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>All HTML tags accept attributes. Attributes are placed inside of the opening tags before the ">". Attributes have names with a value. You can even create your own, but it has to start with "data-" (ex: data-post-id="") but we'll learn more about that later.</p>

    <p>Here are a few examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>class=""</li>
        <li>id=""</li>
        <li>href=""</li>
        <li>src=""</li>
        <li>title=""</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The most used attributes are class and id, these are the best way for us to target certain elements for our styling (CSS) and logic (javascript).</p>
    <p>If we wanted to have all of our important or special headers be certain color we could add class="important-header" in every h3 opening tag to target the important headers. You're also able to add more than 1 class inside of the quotations (ex: class="important second-class").</p>
    <p>If we give something an id attribute, we can only target that one element, id is meant to only be used once (per html file). If you accidentally use it more than once, it will automatically target the first id. (everything is read from top to bottom). You can add the class attribute in addition if you need to target it with other elements too.</p>
