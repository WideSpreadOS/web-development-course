### The index.html File

If you open index.html file located in this same directory, you will see a blank html file with the very basic and minimal amount of code in order to make a website exist. You will be able to open it with an internet browser, however, there will be absolutely nothing except for a blank white page... BUT, it will still be a website.

### Viewing the index.html in the Browser

Use the your machines file explorer and navigate to this folder, or right click on the index.html file in the VS Code Explorer panel and click "Reveal in File Explorer" or if index.html is highlighted press shift + alt + R. Once you see the index.html file in the file explorer double click and your browser will display the file.
